# Abstract

Employee attrition has been identified as a key issue for organizations because of its adverse impact on work place productivity and long term growth strategies.
Employee attrition prediction is a crucial task for organizations as it helps them identify and mitigate the risk of losing valuable employees. 
To solve this problem, organizations use machine learning techniques to predict employee attrition. Accurate predictions enable organizations to take action for retention or succession planning of employees.
